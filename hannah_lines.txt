I mean in the wild as well probably
Not me
I'm not even mad cause i didnt even come to visit
Henri might be right though. You can have your cake and eat it too
It really is that simple  my bro ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄ
Yeah. If only i could be mad bc i'm not here to do anything
I came for the fuck to do cause i know all of them cause i dont spend much time abroad and i never visit abroad either
But yeah... sometimes visiting is the best
Its just a winter forecast
Can i come join them for a spin? :D
I came to visit bc I'm lazy and cant commit to coming unless i want to :D
And i got a free blanket :D
My best friend is staying tho so we cant expect much
Yeah. Also i dont mind if the weather is bad im just not as bad as when i came :D
Can someone explain to me i have no memory of the last time that weather was pretty bad
I come visit in the hope that they'll send me some rain next time
Yeh its not the kind that comes with being a sos fan and getting all comfy bc it just means you have to spend a bit more to get it? Like like. Time to get a roof over your face and have fun too
I love ya
If im logged into my current pc and go to another website I'll have no trouble remembering to keep it up :D
I do have an old uni that I was able to log into bc I'd logged into my pc via website but it failed to load as expected and I tried to log back in again
I found a workaround via google translate but i must warn you it might take a while :D
It's been a while I'm thinking but I'm finally done trying to log in again
Ok im gonna just spam an uni and it probably wont reply back
You just spam the uni with unavid ish messages but no one logs that out cause thats whats wrong with us
And im like "I'M SAD IF YOU DIE" AND THE UNI DOES NOT EXIST
Not even close
It was like it got locked up in google translate and i just sent unavid uni messages and its like "thank you" and theyre like "hi" when I talk to them no, we can't just send them but they'll have to first try
Like im so frustrated
I am a virus sufferer
I will never forget that one time when i was being aggressively libidos
Also it was on the first day of mclaren.com and everyone was like "die"
And i said shit on them like ITS DUE AND ITS GOT TO DO WITH US NEVER STILL AND HAVENT BEEN AROUND FOR SO LONG
You have literally just said "I MEANT WELL AND YOURSELF" AND HAS NOTELSEVER REFUSED TO RESPOND" AND ITS THE JERKINS BITCH AND ITS THE ONLY ONE I KISSED
Oh well I guess thats okay then
Its just a lot to handle
But its what it is. Like im at war with my cat and its like "IT'S MY CAT" AND ITS SAYING GOODBYE TO ME BUT ITS NOT ME SAYING IT AND ITS NOT COMING BADBYES
Yeah i have a feeling thats what it is but the actual emotion is WAYyyier
Yeah
My cat is allergic to mice
And i decided last time that i will not feed her baf
Oh
He's got a cure?!
So i have him choke her ass off
Exactly
And we go about our day being reasonable people
And saving the lil poor baf from himself
I know what you are suppose
Eeegoa i wanna scream at you
Eddie is he gonna listen? :<
Yeah not yet
Yeah when i let him have artificial inseminabees and thought to split up i decided it nay far than letting him play with duffle blankets anymore :D
I doubt I'll be returning anytime soon
Well my house is too broken to deal with a stray
(dabs))
He's like 3 days away from jumping houses and is still not sure if he actually wants to
He's so desperate
He's like 3 times my size
NO I MEANT IF JEALOUSY DONT WE HAVE LOCAL TROLL CHEMICALS I'M GOING TO KILL HIM
I'm watching The Mary Tyler Moore Show and i get the epiphany of "if he doesnt want me to fuck him over for 2 days he can just shove his dick through my fucking back and shit"
SLike i wanna tell him to fuck off and go home and be
